-- Here are some of the exercises for which you can write SQL queries to self evaluate using all the concepts we have learnt to write SQL Queries.
-- * All the exercises are based on retail tables.
-- * We have already setup the tables and also populated the data.
-- * We will use all the 6 tables in retail database as part of these exercises.

-- Here are the commands to validate the tables
SELECT count(*) FROM departments;
SELECT count(*) FROM categories;
SELECT count(*) FROM products;
SELECT count(*) FROM orders;
SELECT count(*) FROM order_items;
SELECT count(*) FROM customers;

-- ### Exercise 1 - Customer order count

-- Get order count per customer for the month of 2014 January.

-- * Tables - `orders` and `customers`
-- * Data should be sorted in descending order by count and ascending order by customer id.
-- * Output should contain `customer_id`, `customer_fname`, `customer_lname` and `customer_order_count`.

-- Get the customer details who have not placed any order for the month of 2014 January.
-- * Tables - `orders` and `customers`
-- * Output Columns - **All columns from customers as is**
-- * Data should be sorted in ascending order by `customer_id`
-- * Output should contain all the fields from `customers`
-- * Make sure to run below provided validation queries and validate the output.
